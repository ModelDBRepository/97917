This is the readme for the model from the paper

Hines, Eichner, and Schuermann (2008)
Neuron splitting in compute-bound parallel network simulations enables
runtime scaling with twice as many processors.
J Comput Neurosci (accepted).

The pardentategyrus and nrntraub folders contain splitcell
parallelized versions of the ModelDB models used in fig 3 of the above
paper.

Original serial versions of the models are at
http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=51781
http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=45539
Splitcell modifications to the Santhakumar model began with the
pardentategyrus code at
http://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb/ShowModel.asp?model=64229

Note: for autolaunch from ModelDB, after the choice of which of the two
figure 3 models to run, an attempt is made to do the appropriate
nrnivmodl or mknrndll and dynamically load the shared library or dll.
The simulation will stop after setup when launched using the mosinit.hoc
file.

In the pardentgyrus directory, see bg.sh for an example of how
these simulations were run in parallel on the BlueGene.

Changelog
---------
20140403 splitcell/nrntraub/mod/ri.mod had char* secname(); changed to
         const char* secname(); to conform with ansi C compiler in new
         NEURON version.
20220523 Updated MOD files to contain valid C++ and be compatible with
         the upcoming versions 8.2 and 9.0 of NEURON.
